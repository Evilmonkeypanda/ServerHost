# ServerHost
ServerHost for my ChatApp project

This is a very simple app and it was the secondary priority when making ChatApp.
There isn't much error handling because there's not much that can go wrong but at a later date
I might come back and clean it up a bit. For now it does the job though.

Can be a bit cpu intensive with a lot of clients. I wouldn't know I haven't stress tested it.
Please don't use this for messaging people. It's just PoC.
Please.
